        "Fire Preparation":"I think you want to learn something about fire preparation. When preparing for a wildfire, you should pay attention to your home and prepare for an evacuation. What would you like to know about?",
        "Evacuations":"First, make sure to follow all evacuation orders for your own safety. If you are being told to leave, it\u2019s important to do so, regardless of what you have packed. However, if you have time before your evacuation, assemble an emergency supply kit for each person in your household. Make sure to gather important documents, prescriptions, eyeglasses, and important medical equipment. Be sure to take your pets with you and do not leave them in your home with no way to escape.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re preparing before a wildfire occurs, you can gather additional emergency supplies and create a wildfire action plan. Designate a meeting area for your family, and create a list of emergency contacts well outside of your area so you have a place to stay. \r\n\r\nTo learn more about a wildfire evacuation plan, go to: https:\/\/www.readyforwildfire.org\/prepare-for-wildfire\/get-set\/wildfire-action-plan\/",
        "Emergency Supply Kit":"The basic necessities of a fire emergency kit include:\r\n\u2022 Water\r\n\u2022 Flashlight\r\n\u2022 Non-Perishable food\r\n\u2022 Phone and electronics chargers\r\n\u2022 Battery-powered radio\r\n\u2022 First aid kit\r\n\u2022 Extra batteries\r\n\u2022 Sanitation supplies\r\n\u2022 Copies of important documents\r\n\u2022 N95 respirators\r\n\u2022 Extra change of clothes for your climate and sturdy shoes\r\n\r\n\r\nIf applicable:\r\n\u2022 Menstrual products and personal hygiene items\r\n\u2022 Prescription medications, eyeglasses, and medical equipment\r\n\u2022 Infant formula, bottles, diapers, wipes, and diaper rash cream\r\n\u2022 Pet food\/ accessories and extra water for the pet\r\n\r\n\r\nTo learn more about what to pack in an emergency supply kit, go to: https:\/\/www.ready.gov\/kit",
        "Prepare Your Home":"In order for a fire to start, it needs fuel and a source. Remember to remove flammable materials, such as dry brush and dead leaves, from around your home.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s also important to be attentive to anything that could start a flame, such as cigarette butts and burning coals.\r\n\r\nEven if you don\u2019t see a flame, it can still start a fire! For specific actions you can take to protect yourself and your neighbors, go to: \r\nhttps:\/\/smokeybear.com\/en\/prevention-how-tos\/equipment-use-and-maintenance\/how-to-prepare-your-home-for-wildfire\r\n",
        "My Fire Risk":"To check if you live in a generally high-risk fire zone, use the map found here: \r\nhttps:\/\/kqednews.carto.com\/builder\/4732dc15-cfc0-4dbb-865e-371b693239d5\/embed\r\n\r\nThe risk of wildfire can also change daily based on the weather. High-risk areas will likely have a daily fire danger rating. To find updates on your current local fire danger rating, go to: https:\/\/www.fire.ca.gov\/programs\/communications\/red-flag-warnings-fire-weather-watches\/ ",
        "Fire Ecology":"I think you want to learn something about fire ecology. Fire ecology is the scientific study of the causes and characteristics of fires. What would you like to know about?",
        "How \ud83d\udd25 Starts":"Fire only needs three things to start: fuel, oxygen, and a spark. Roughly 87-95% percent of the time, wildland fires are caused by humans.\r\n\r\nDowned power lines are the most common cause, but others include leaving campfires unattended, burning debris, setting off fireworks, improper cigarette disposal, and acts of arson. The rest of the time, fire is caused by nature through lightning, lava, or (very rarely) through spontaneous combustion of dry fuel.\r\n\r\nDry grass covers much of California, which provides ample fuel for a blaze. Certain weather conditions such as dry heats, droughts, and high winds can feed a spark, turning it from a small flame into a big fire. For a more detailed explanation, go to: https:\/\/www.nationalgeographic.com\/environment\/article\/wildfires or https:\/\/www.anthropocenemagazine.org\/2020\/09\/humans-cause-most-wildfires-that-threaten-homes-in-the-united-states\/\r\n",
        "Fire Frequency":"Fires are a natural part of California\u2019s ecosystem and many species depend on them. However, they\u2019ve been increasing in number. There are 4 main reasons for the frequent fires, which are interconnected and often feed into one another: \n\n\n1) Climate change exacerbates conditions already prone to fires. There is a lack of rainfall during the summer season, and the increasing temperatures dry out vegetation, making it easier to catch fire.\n\n\n2) People are the most common cause of wildfires in California, with many being started by downed power lines.\n\n\n3) Wildfire suppression, or the intentional extinguishing of beneficial wildfires, has led to unnatural build-ups of dry vegetation that would otherwise be burned in small, manageable fires. California is trying to combat this with controlled burns.\n\n\n4) The Santa Ana winds are annual dry winds that blow across the state, drying out the environment and carrying sparks, causing fires to spread faster.\n\nFor more information on the 4 main causes, go to: \nhttps:\/\/www.seattletimes.com\/nation-world\/why-does-california-have-so-many-wildfires-4-key-reasons\/\nFor more general information, particularly on the environmental causes, go to:\nhttps:\/\/www.greenmatters.com\/p\/why-does-california-have-so-many-wildfires\/\n",
        "Climate Change":"Climate change has increased the number and intensity of fires. Higher temperatures take water out of the air, making it easier for fires to start, and dry out vegetation, providing a lot of fuel if one does. In addition, it affects rainfall and snow pack, elongating the drying season. \r\n\r\nWhile California has always had fires, dry heats, and droughts, the rise in global temperatures has made it a lot worse. Recent fires are hotter, cover more area, and are harder to put out. The average annual area burned now is 5 times more than it was a few decades ago. \r\n\r\nFor more information, go to: \r\nhttps:\/\/www.c2es.org\/content\/wildfires-and-climate-change\/\r\nhttps:\/\/www.nationalgeographic.com\/science\/article\/climate-change-increases-risk-fires-western-us",
        "Fire Season":"California fire season classically starts in May and hits peak risk in August, through the end of the season. In Northern California, the end is typically in October, and in Southern California, November or December. However, climate change is making the season start earlier and end later.\r\n\r\nIt is largely believed there is no longer a fire season, since fire risk is high year-round. Scientists theorize there are two different fire seasons entirely, separated by month and cause. The first, from June through September, is caused by drier and hotter weather, and mainly impacts forests. The second, from October through April, is caused by the Santa Ana winds, and has fast fires near urban areas.\r\n\r\nFor more information, go to: \r\nhttps:\/\/www.frontlinewildfire.com\/when-california-fire-season\/\r\nhttps:\/\/www.seattletimes.com\/nation-world\/why-does-california-have-so-many-wildfires-4-key-reasons\/",
        "Wildlife":"When a wildfire happens, initially only the old or young, and sick or injured cannot outrun it and perish, but most deaths occur after the fire. New, open terrain, without food or shelter, gives invasive species the chance to take over. \r\n\r\nDespite the casualties, wildfires are natural and many trees depend on them. However, they can\u2019t withstand the recent, high-intensity fires, and what used to be part of a healthy ecosystem has instead started devastating it. As large areas of forest burn, it struggles to regenerate.\r\n\r\nFor more information on wildlife, go to:\r\nhttps:\/\/www.nationalforests.org\/blog\/what-happens-to-wildlife-during-a-wildfire For more information on trees, go to:\r\nhttps:\/\/insideclimatenews.org\/news\/21122016\/california-forests-wildfires-climate-change\/\r\n",
        "How \ud83d\udd25 Spreads":"If there are high winds (specifically Santa Ana winds), the fire is moving uphill, or there is a lot of dry vegetation, a fire will spread faster. Wildfires can move as fast as 7 mph in forests and up to 14 mph in grasslands.\r\n\r\nWhile that might not seem fast, it\u2019s too fast to out-run, and fire can quickly block roads, making it extremely hard to navigate and out-drive it. It\u2019s very important to evacuate when told to do so.\r\n\r\nFor more information, go to: \r\nhttps:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/startswithabang\/2017\/09\/06\/the-terrifying-physics-of-how-wildfires-spread-so-fast\/?sh=1ce0199b7791\r\n\r\nTo see an example of how fast a fire can spread, go to: \r\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/hRDM3ir3l5M \r\n\r\nFor a timeline of fire spread, go to: \r\nhttps:\/\/www.disastercompany.com\/quickly-fire-spread\/\r\n",
        "Contain & Control":"Containment is how much of the fire that has been enclosed by a control line. A wildfire with 25% containment means there are control lines around 25% of the fire\u2019s perimeter. Contained fires are fully enclosed and not likely to spread, but may still be burning.\r\n\r\nControl lines are natural\/man-made barriers used to stop a wildfire from spreading, also called firebreaks or fuel breaks. Sometimes, controlled burns are used to remove fuel before the wildfire reaches it. Controlled fires are contained and the lines have been reinforced, making spread very unlikely.\r\n\r\nFor containment and control updates on current fires, go to:\r\nhttps:\/\/www.fire.ca.gov\/incidents\/",
        "Prevent\/Stop \ud83d\udd25":"Prevention limits the ability of a devastating wildfire to start. Prescribed fires get rid of dry vegetation to keep fuel from building up. Addressing climate change helps in many different ways as well. Lastly, since humans start the most fires, fire safety information campaigns and improved power line infrastructure is extremely important.\r\n\r\nFor more information on prevention, go to: \r\nhttps:\/\/www.fire.ca.gov\/programs\/resource-management\/resource-protection-improvement\/vegetation-management-program\/\r\n\r\nSuppression controls the damage an active fire can cause. Dumping water on fires is well-known, but firefighting foam can also be used. Boundaries are made by targeting unburned areas. Back-burning and vegetation removal eliminate fuel sources. Spraying fire retardant and water makes fuel harder to burn.\r\n\r\nFor more information on suppression, go to: \r\nhttps:\/\/www.enr.gov.nt.ca\/en\/services\/wildfire-operations\/suppressing-wildland-fires ",
        "List Of Fires":"Information on current major wildfires can be found on Cal Fire\u2019s website. Past incidents can be found by year under the \u201cIncidents\u201d tab at the top. https:\/\/www.fire.ca.gov\/incidents\/",
        "Emergency Protocols":"I think you want to learn something about what to do in an emergency. If you are in an emergency and need immediate assistance, please call 911. What would you like to know about?",
        "When \ud83d\udd25 Is Nearby":"If you can, follow all evacuation orders. If you have time, pack an emergency supply kit. N95 respirators will protect you from smoke inhalation. Fire can travel fast, so leave quickly.\r\n\r\nTake wide, main roads, since they\u2019re less likely to be blocked. In cars, keep the headlights on, windows shut, and recirculate your air rather than drawing more from outside.\r\n\r\nIf you can\u2019t evacuate, call 911 and shelter in place. It\u2019s important to stay calm and gather all house members, including pets.\r\n\r\nSheltering in a house:\r\n\u2022 Wet your lawn and roof with water\r\n\u2022 Fill sinks, bathtubs, and buckets with water\r\n\u2022 Turn off gas and propane to prevent an explosion\r\n\u2022 Move flammable items away from the house, especially doors and windows\r\n\u2022 Close all doors and windows but leave them unlocked\r\n\u2022 Stay inside your house\r\n\u2022 Don\u2019t go near outermost walls, doors, or windows\r\n\r\nSheltering in a vehicle:\r\n\u2022 Park in a place as clear of vegetation as possible\r\n\u2022 Close all windows and vents\r\n\u2022 Cover yourself with a wool blanket or jacket\r\n\u2022 Lie on the floor of the vehicle\r\n\r\nSheltering in the open:\r\n\u2022 Go to an area as clear of vegetation as possible\r\n\u2022 Find a ditch or depression on level ground, if possible\r\n\u2022 Lie face down, cover your body\r\n",
        "Treating Burns":"If the skin is white or charred black, has a dry or waxy appearance, or if there is little to no pain, this is a very serious burn. Call 911 and urgently follow the extreme burn steps if no emergency medical aid is available.\r\n\r\n\r\nExtreme burns: Damage to all layers of skin and possibly underlying fat, muscle, and bone\r\nSymptoms include the skin being white\/charred black or waxy\/dry, the burn going deep, and little to no pain\r\nIMMEDIATELY CALL 911\r\n\r\n\r\nTreatment:\r\n\u2022 Protect from further burns; take special care with electrocutions\r\n\u2022 Check for breathing; if not breathing, start CPR\r\n\u2022 Remove tight items, like rings, from burn area and neck\r\n\u2022 Cover burn with cool, clean, moist cloth or bandage\r\n\u2022 Elevate burned area above the heart\r\n\u2022 Monitor closely for excessive bleeding, not breathing, and signs of shock\r\n\u2022 DO NOT submerge or run under water\r\n\u2022 DO NOT attempt to remove cloth stuck to the burn\r\n\u2022 DO NOT use fluffy cotton\r\n\r\nMild burns: Occurs on layers of skin only \r\nSymptoms include redness, pain, significant swelling, splotchy skin, blisters, and peeling\r\n\r\nTreatment:\r\n\u2022 Remove tight items, like rings, from burn area\r\n\u2022 Cool down burn by submerging or running under cool water or with a wet compress until pain eases\r\n\u2022 Apply lotion, moisturizer, or aloe vera to avoid drying\r\n\u2022 Cover with gauze and wrap lightly\r\n\u2022 DO NOT use ice or cold water\r\n\u2022 DO NOT use fluffy cotton or wrap tightly\r\n\u2022 DO NOT break blisters; wash out if a break occurs\r\n\r\nIf the burn is larger than 3 inches, or is on your face, scalp, genitals, hands, feet, or major joints, get same-day medical treatment or go to urgent care. It\u2019s okay to take pain medication if needed.\r\n\r\nFor more detailed information, go to:\r\nhttps:\/\/www.mayoclinic.org\/first-aid\/first-aid-burns\/basics\/art-20056649\r\n",
        "Smoke Protection":"Wear an N95 mask. Avoid going outside or exercising as you\u2019ll inhale more smoke. When in the car, close windows and re-circulate the air. When at home, close windows and doors and stay in a room closed off from outside air. If the smoke gets too bad, you may need to evacuate.\r\n\r\nFor more information, go to:\r\nhttps:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/disasters\/wildfires\/duringfire.html\r\nTo check your air quality, go to:\r\nhttps:\/\/www.airnow.gov\/",
        "Smoke Impact":"Smoke\u2019s biggest health threat is from fine particles. They can penetrate deep into your lungs and cause a range of health problems, from burning eyes and a runny nose to aggravated chronic heart and lung diseases.\r\n\r\nExposure to particle pollution is even linked to premature death. For more information, go to: \r\nhttps:\/\/www.epa.gov\/pm-pollution\/how-smoke-fires-can-affect-your-health ",
        "Fire Recovery":"I think you want to learn more about recovering from fires. If you are a wildfire victim, I\u2019m sorry for the hardships you\u2019re going through. What would you like to know about?",
        "Community After \ud83d\udd25":"Once they\u2019re done dealing with the fire, CAL FIRE will help communities in many ways, including repairing road damage, installing waterbars, and addressing public safety issues. Some organizations, like the California Wildfire Relief fund, support the more intermediate and long-term recovery efforts after major fires. Recovery relies heavily on volunteers and donations. Unfortunately, public interest often moves on before the recovery is completed, causing a lack of funds and hands to provide long-term recovery.\n\nFor more information, go to: \nhttps:\/\/aftertheflames.com\/\nhttps:\/\/www.readyforwildfire.org\/post-wildfire\/who-can-help\/\n",
        "Going Home After \ud83d\udd25":"Even though a fire is put out, the area might still be dangerous. Natural disasters like flash floods are common, buildings and trees can have unseen structural damage, and embers can still be burning under the debris. Don\u2019t return home until you\u2019re told it\u2019s safe to do so, and be cautious once you do.\n\nWhen you get to your home, check thoroughly for gas leaks and turn off the power while you inspect everything. Avoid making any sparks. It\u2019s crucial to check every inch of your property for any embers, sparks, or hotspots. Just because you don\u2019t see anything doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s safe. Once you\u2019ve deemed the property safe, you can turn the electricity back on. \n\nDon\u2019t drink tap water until you\u2019re told it\u2019s safe and discard any food items with fire damage. If your possessions have fire damage, it is safer to discard them.\n\nCheck your insurance policy for wildfire coverage and begin cleanup with the help of the government or a private contractor.\n\nFor CAL FIRE\u2019s return checklists, go to: \nhttps:\/\/www.readyforwildfire.org\/post-wildfire\/after-a-wildfire\/\nhttps:\/\/www.readyforwildfire.org\/post-wildfire\/returning-home\/",
